# React Website Checklist

This project is in the process of being made while first learning react. It ties in with google's Firebase database that updates in real-time so I can have my own personalized checklist, with the ability to add more, for use at work and on the side.

<li>React</li>
<li>React router</li>

</ol>

<li>Learn more about react and firebase, best way to tie them together</li>
